            <h3>WikiWho APIs</h3>
            <p>
                The APIs provide provenance and change information about the tokens a Wikipedia article consists of, for
                several languages. Apart from the source language edition they draw from, their specifications and usage
                are
                identical, as described below.
                <br>
                {% for language in languages %}
                    <br>
                    {#                    <a href="{% url 'api:swagger' ww_version_url %}">WikiWho API EN</a>#}
                    <a href="{% translate_url language.code 'api:swagger' ww_version_url %}">WikiWho
                        API {{ language.code|upper }}</a>
                {% endfor %}
            </p>
            <h4>Quick Start</h4>
            <p>
                The quickest way to get started is following our <a href="https://notebooks.gesis.org/binder/jupyter/user/gesiscss-wikiwho_tutorial-ayi6dqvv/notebooks/1.%20API%20requests%20%28WikiWho%20wrapper%29.ipynb">WikiWho Tutorial</a>. Or, you can also check the <a href="https://notebooks.gesis.org/binder/v2/gh/gesiscss/wikiwho_demo/master?urlpath=%2Fapps%2F1.%20General%20Metadata%20of%20a%20Wikipedia%20Article.ipynb">WikiWho Demo</a> for some applied ideas.
                </p>

                Both of them use the  <a href="https://pypi.org/project/wikiwho-wrapper/"> WikiWho Wrapper</a>, a Python 3 package that can be installed through pypi:
                <pre><code>pip install wikiwho_wrapper</code></pre>
                The WikiWho wrapper provide easy access to the API:

                <pre><code>from wikiwho_wrapper import WikiWho
ww = WikiWho(lng='de') # or WikiWho(USERNAME, PASSWORD, lng='de')

#You can either use api to directly access the JSON (raw format from api.wikiwho.net)
response = ww.api.all_content("Bioglass")

# Or you can use the dataview to obtain a pandas DataFrame with the data
dataView = ww.dv.all_content("Bioglass")
</code></pre>
            
            <h4>Usage</h4>
            <p>
                For each article page, the API mirrors its current state on the Wikipedia.
                The API is based on the <a href="https://github.com/wikiwho" target="_blank">WikiWho algorithm</a> (~95% acc.).
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, there is a limit of 2000 requests/day for unregistered users, and also a 60 requests/minute
                limit
                for all users.
            </p>
            Terminology used:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i>"Wikipedia"</i>: A selected language version of Wikipedia. Available languages can be chosen from
                    the
                    top navigation bar.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>"article (page)"</i>: Any Wikipedia page in <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Namespace" target="_blank">namespace = 0.</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>"(article) content"</i>: The tokenized Wiki Markup text content of a (range of) revision(s) of an
                    article page, not the front-end HTML (if you want that, you have to "untokenize" and appropriately
                    parse
                    it; the original order of tokens is retained – or take a look at the <a href="#whocolor_api">WhoColor
                    API)</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>"token"/"tokenized"</i>: The Wiki Markup text is split at (i) white spaces and (ii) certain
                    special
                    characters (special chars also act as tokens). E.g., tokens in
                    <tokens>"A [[house]], a boat."</tokens>
                    are
                    <tokens>"a", "[[", "house", "]]", ",", "a", "boat", "."
                    </tokens>
                    I.e., all tokens are converted into lower-case and certain
                    character combinations that have a specific function in Wiki Markup, such as double-square brackets,
                    get treated as single tokens. >> <a

                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>"revisions"</i>: The article revisions and their IDs as retrieved from Wikipedia, with one
                    exception:
                    The WikiWho algorithm implements a (very lenient) filter to avoid spending time DIFFing blatant
                    vandalism which gets immediately reverted after. About 0.5% of the revisions from Wikipedia are
                    hence not available here as we consider those changes to have disappeared immediately. This is a
                    temporary constraint to be removed in an upcoming version.

            <h3>WhoColor APIs</h3>
            <p>This collection of APIs can be thought of as an additional service on top of the core WikiWho data
                described above, available for the same languages. The same term descriptions as above apply.
            </p>
            <p>The goal is to deliver annotated HTML of a Wiki article that can be read by a browser (instead of
                annotated, tokenized Wikitext as delivered by the primary API). </p>
            <p>Annotations available per token (realized via &lt;span&gt;) are currently:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>original revision and author</li>
                <li>changes applied</li>
                <li>conflict score</li>
            </ul>
            <p>plus certain metadata (e.g., ‘present’ authors and their percentages of words originally written in the
                current revision, revision list with metadata).
            </p>
            <p>The main use case so far (hence the name) is colored annotation of text parts with this meta information,
                for example in a Grease-/Tampermonkey userscript we developed, which runs in a browser extension and can
                be used on any Wikipedia article to find out how wrote and changed which words via simple visual
                inspection. <a href="https://f-squared.org/whovisual/#color" target="_blank">Find our more here</a>. </p>
            <p>
                Note that this API project is still in alpha, several elements of Wiki pages <a
                    href="https://github.com/wikiwho/WhoColor/issues" target="_blank">cannot yet be annotated,
                such as Tables, Infoboxes (or any templates), certain references.</a>
